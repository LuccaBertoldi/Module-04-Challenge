# Module-04-Challenge

Blog Full Stack

## Description

This Challenge is a blog, where you can add your post with title and content, and it will show your post on the other page with the username you added on the form, both pages there is a way of changing the website to dark mode. I had a lot of trouble trying to make the post stay on the page when you click on the back button, I was not able to do it so just removed from the website.

## Usage

To use the website, there is a form on the index page where you added your username, your title for the blog and the content for it, when you click the submit button it will show an alert if you added all the info saying that it was posted, if you miss any information on the form, an alert will appear saying to you fill the whole form. When you click the sun on the page, it will toggle to dark mode. On the blog page, it shows the content added previously, and there is a back button to add another post. the same for the Sun button to toggle to dark mode.
